# OPORD-PR-CYBR-SECURITY-8

## 1. OPERATIONAL SUMMARY
The objective of this OPORD is to update the PR-CYBR-SECURITY-AGENTâ€™s files to facilitate the loading of users into an interactive terminal program. This will be accomplished through executing a setup script that employs TMUX to create multiple terminal windows for enhanced user interaction.

## 2. SITUATION
A robust security framework is vital for the success of the PR-CYBR initiative. Continuous improvements and management of security systems are necessary to safeguard against evolving cyber threats and ensure system integrity.

## 3. MISSION
The PR-CYBR-SECURITY-AGENT is tasked with updating the following files:
- `src/main.py`
- `scripts/setup.sh`
- `setup.py`
- `tests/test-setup.py`
- `README.md`

These updates will ensure that the script utilizes `scripts/setup.sh`, deploying TMUX to create four interactive terminal windows as described.

## 4. EXECUTION

### 4.A. CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS
The mission will focus on enhancing the security posture through improved interactive systems that allow for efficient monitoring and incident response.

### 4.B. TASKS
1. **File Updates**
   - Modify `src/main.py` to correctly initiate the setup process.
   - Adjust `scripts/setup.sh` to clone necessary security scripts and configure TMUX windows.
   - Update `setup.py` for any additional dependencies related to security protocols.
   - Enhance `tests/test-setup.py` to encompass security validation tests.
   - Revise `README.md` to outline updated security procedures and functionalities.

2. **Implementation of TMUX**
   - Clone the aliases repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/cywf/aliases.git
     cd aliases
     cp bash_aliases /home/$USER/.bash_aliases
     source ~/.bashrc
     cd install-scripts && chmod +x tmux-install.sh
     ./tmux-install.sh
     tmux new -s pr-cybr
     ```
   - Establish the following terminal windows:
     - **Window 1**: Display a welcome message, options, and a loading progress bar.
     - **Window 2**: Run `htop` for ongoing system monitoring and health checks.
     - **Window 3**: Use `tail -f` to monitor security logs produced by `scripts/setup.sh`.
     - **Window 4**: Present the output of `ls -l` in the root directory for security file management.

## 5. ADMINISTRATION AND LOGISTICS
- Updates should be carefully documented and reflected in version control.
- A comprehensive review of new functionalities should be conducted with relevant stakeholders post-implementation.

## 6. COMMAND AND SIGNAL
- Regular updates should be communicated through established PR-CYBR communication channels.
- Ensure that all agents are aware of the security functionalities to foster collaboration.

**This OPORD mandates the PR-CYBR-SECURITY-AGENT to execute its responsibilities in alignment with the organization's strategic security objectives.**
