# PR-CYBR-SECURITY-AGENT

## Overview

The **PR-CYBR-SECURITY-AGENT** is a specialized tool designed to enhance the cybersecurity posture of the PR-CYBR ecosystem. It identifies, mitigates, and reports vulnerabilities, ensuring the safety and resilience of interconnected systems.

## Key Features

- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Proactively scans repositories and environments for security issues.
- **Threat Mitigation**: Provides actionable steps to address detected vulnerabilities.
- **Security Auditing**: Validates adherence to best practices across codebases and infrastructure.
- **Integration with CI/CD**: Seamlessly integrates with pipelines to enforce security gates before deployment.
- **Reporting and Alerts**: Generates detailed security reports and sends alerts for critical findings.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Git**: For cloning the repository.
- **Python 3.8+**: Required for running scripts.
- **Docker**: Required for containerization and deployment.
- **Access to GitHub Actions**: For automated workflows.

### Local Setup

To set up the `PR-CYBR-SECURITY-AGENT` locally on your machine:

1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PR-CYBR/PR-CYBR-SECURITY-AGENT.git
cd PR-CYBR-SECURITY-AGENT
```

2. **Run Local Setup Script**

```bash
./scripts/local_setup.sh
```
_This script will install necessary dependencies and set up the local environment._

3. **Provision the Agent**

```bash
./scripts/provision_agent.sh
```
_This script configures the agent with default settings for local development._

### Cloud Deployment

To deploy the agent to a cloud environment:

1. **Configure Repository Secrets**

- Navigate to `Settings` > `Secrets and variables` > `Actions` in your GitHub repository.
- Add the required secrets:
   - `CLOUD_API_KEY`
   - `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`
   - `DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD`
   - Any other cloud-specific credentials.

2. **Deploy Using GitHub Actions**

- The Docker Compose deployment specification is stored in `deploy/docker-compose.yml`.
- Push changes to the `main` branch to trigger the deployment workflow automatically.

3. **Manual Deployment**

- Use the deployment script for manual deployment:

```bash
./scripts/deploy_agent.sh
```

- Ensure you have Docker and cloud CLI tools installed and configured on your machine.

## Integration

The `PR-CYBR-SECURITY-AGENT` integrates with other PR-CYBR agents to provide comprehensive security coverage. It communicates with:

- **PR-CYBR-CI-CD-AGENT**: Integrates into the CI/CD pipeline to perform security scans before deployments.
- **PR-CYBR-BACKEND-AGENT** and **PR-CYBR-FRONTEND-AGENT**: Scans codebases and applications for vulnerabilities.
- **PR-CYBR-INFRASTRUCTURE-AGENT**: Ensures infrastructure configurations meet security standards.
- **PR-CYBR-MGMT-AGENT**: Reports security status and incidents for oversight and decision-making.

## Usage

- **Development**

  - Start the security tools:

```bash
python setup.py develop
```

  - Configure scanning parameters in the `config/` directory.

- **Testing**

  - Run security tests:

```bash
python -m unittest discover tests
```

- **Building for Production**

  - Build the agent for production use:

```bash
python setup.py install
```
